    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The <strong><em>Filipino island of Cebu</em></strong> is famous for its <strong>lechon</strong>, which is considered to be the <em>juiciest and crispiest</em> in the Philippines. This <em>traditional recipe</em> calls for a few specific ingredients. For instance, the inside of the pig is brushed with <em>soy sauce</em> and filled with <em>lemongrass</em>, <em>start anise</em>, <em>bay leaves</em>, <em>garlic</em> and <em>saba</em> bananas - a particular type of cooking bananas typical for the Filipino cuisine. The glazing, on the other hand, is done by basting the pig's skin with Sprite, which is believed to give it that perfect crispiness.</p>
